								<p>Solar energy is becoming an increasingly popular source of energy due to its sustainability, 
										renewable, and eco-friendly. Photovoltaic panels (PV panels) are devices used to convert the solar 
										energy to electrical energy. They are versatile, as they can be mounted on different surfaces, such as 
										ground, rooftop, or walls. The mount can be fixed, or it may utilize a solar tracker to follow the 
										trajectory of the sun. With the demand of solar energy on a rise as an alternative to meet the increasing 
										electricity demands, solar trackers are becoming a popular method to harvest solar energy more efficiently</p> 
									<p></p>
									<p>The solar tracking prototype developed is a dual-axis tracker, meaning that its movement is based on the 
										position of the solar arrays and is by rotation about two axes: the vertical and horizontal axis. The 
										development of the prototype made use of an Arduino, two servo motors, and Light Depending Resistors (LDR) 
										which is used to detect the sun light and are a cost-effective option to utilize for this project. Servo 
										motors are used to move the tracker since they can sustain high torque and can be controlled within 
										precise angles. The Arduino is used to program the functionality of the solar tracker and two independent 
										PID controller loops (one for each axis) are used to automate this process.</p>

									<p>Solar trackers are used to orient PV panels toward the sun. To make solar trackers more efficient, 
										it is best to design them such that they absorb maximum amount of sunlight as possible. This can be done 
										by ensuring that the solar tracker maintains a perpendicular profile to the rays and has a relatively 
										quick response time. Single-axis solar trackers are widely used; however, they capture minimum energy 
										since the tracking is limited to rotation about the vertical axis and the tracker can only span a 2D plane. 
										Thus, dual-axis tracking is used in this experiment to get maximum exposure to sun rays. This means the 
										movement of the tracker is rotation about the vertical and horizontal planes and can span 3D space </p>


								<h3> Implementation Details</h3>

								<h4>PID Controller Design</h4>

									<p>To implement the solar tracker, two PID controllers were used to calculate the appropriate servo motor 
										 angles based on feedback sensor data. <br/>
											From the block diagram shown below, there are two independent PID control loops. One for the bottom 
											servo motor (which is responsible for correcting the error in y-axis) and the top servo motor 
											(which is responsible for correcting the error in x-axis).</p>
									<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\Block diagrams.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:550px;height:450px;"></a>

									<p></p>
									<p> Even though the solar tracker robot spans 3D space (which is traditionally controlled using 
											inverse-kinematics), we can simplify the control design by designating a body-attached coordinate 
											frame on the end-effector of the robot. This is shown in figure below along with the LDR (Light dependant resistor) sensor 
											positioning. </p>

											<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\LDR map.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:475px;height:400px;"></a>
									<P>The LDR sensors act as a feedback to locate the (x, y) coordinates of where the light source is. Which LDR has the highest 
										light reading determines which direction and the actual value of the LDR reading gives insight into the magnitude of how far away. 
										This direction and magnitude in conjunction are used to calculate the (x, y) coordinates of the light source </P>

										<h4>Code Implementation</h4>
									<P>The Arduino code developed for the PID Solar Tracker was designed to continually calculate where the end effector of the solar tracker 
										needs to move and by how much to center itself at the greatest concentration of light. </P>
									<P>The first part of the code focused on declaring and initializing the variables needed throughout the code. 
										These variables were either global variables that were needed in several parts of the code or general 
										constant declarations for cleaner and easier to debug software. This included the minimum and maximum 
										angles of the two servo motors, which were initialized at 0 and 180, respectively. The analog pins for 
										the six input LDR sensors (one for every 60-degree interval to span the entire circle of the end-effector) 
										were then initialized, as shown below</P>

									<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code1.png" alt=""  style="width:35%;"></a>

									<P></P>
									<p>The second part of the Arduino code needed to get the light tracker functional was to initialize PID control
										 parameters such as error values and the necessary gains. There are two motors and two degrees of freedom 
										 for this project, and thus two sets of controller variables were created; one for each in the vertical 
										 and horizontal directions, as shown below</p>
								
										 <a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code2.png" alt="" style="width:45%;"></a>

									<p></p>
									<P>After declaring the necessary variables, the actuators (i.e. servo motors) and input sensors (i.e. LDRs) 
										are setup. This includes setting the pinMode to be input for the LDR pins and assigning the PWM control pins 
										for the servo motors to the servoY and servoX objects.</P>

										<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code3.png" alt="" style="width:45%;"></a>

										<h4>Robot Homing</h4>
									<P>For our project implementation, part of the setup procedure is to home the robot. This is necessary as
										 for consistency and operation of the robot, the end-effect should start being positioned upwards. Since
											the end-effector is designed in segments with barriers that cast a shadow on the LDRs that are facing 
											away from the light source, if the robot end-effector is pointed downwards, it will be difficult for 
											it to detect any light (as most of the sensors will be in the shadow) and will take a long time to 
											figure out where the light source is. Having the robot start in this position also helps performs 
											other necessary start up tasks such as calculating the tolerance value. </P>

											<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code4.png" alt="" style="width:25%;"></a>

									<P></P>
									<P>From the code snippet for the HomeRobot() function above, it can be noted that the robot moves 
										to two positions as part of its homing procedure. The first position corresponds to 0 degrees on both 
										motors and the second position corresponds to 90 degrees on both motors (this is the upright position).
										 The first position is simply used for consistency. Before having added this first position, it was 
										 found that depending on the robotâ€™s position prior to homing and how far away it is from the upright 
										 position, it would sometimes over or undershoot due to the inertia of the masses coupled to the servo 
										 motors. </P>

										 <a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\Robot home.jpg" alt="" class="center" style="width:75%;"></a>
										<p></p>

										<h4>PID Implementation</h4>
										<p>After homing the robot, the robot can begin tracking the light. This is done using a PID controller.</p>
										<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code5.png" alt="" style="width:55%;"></a>

										<p></p>
										<p>As discussed in the PID Controller Design section, there are two individual PID loops for both x and y.
											 The error is determined using the method outlined in the PID Controller Design and implemented 
											 programmatically using the developed function called SenseCoord() while passing the parameter of 
											 interest (i.e. x or y). <br/>
												There are three main steps in the function SenseCoord() to determine this error. Firstly, the code 
												prompts the six light dependent resistors to read analog values for each and stores all the readings 
												in an array called valLDR[]. The code then determines the LDR that produced the smallest analogRead() 
												value, as that is the light dependent resistor that is obtaining the most amount of light. 
												</p>

														</div>
														</div>
												<p></p>
												<P>Lastly, the x and y coordinates were obtained. This is done through a series of if statements.
													 Based on which LDR is the brightest, the unit vector for x Ì‚ and y Ì‚ are determined using basic 
													 trigonometry for 60-degree triangles (since each LDR is 60 degrees apart). At this point, the 
													 direction of the light source is known, but how far away it is still needs to be determined. 
													 This is accomplished by calculating a magnitude by simply subtracting the analogRead() values 
													 for the brightest LDR with the analogRead() value of its opposite LDR. This is represented as 
													 the variable mag in the code. If the light source is far from the center of the end-effector, 
													 this magnitude will be large as the opposite LDR will be mostly in the shadow and hence have a 
													 very different reading. If the light source is close to the center of the end-effector, this 
													 magnitude will be small as the brightest LDR and its opposite will have a similar reading. The 
													 position of the light source is finally determined by multiplying the unit vector direction 
													 components by the magnitude. Since the desired position is just (0, 0) the error is the same 
													 as the sensed position. In the code, the error of x is represented as the variable x_sen and 
													 the error of y is represented as the variable y_sen.</P>

													 <a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\code8.png" alt="" style="width:55%;"></a>
													<P></P>
													<p>The PID portion is broken down into the five parts as can be observed in the figure above. 
														The first part determines which way the end effector needs to rotate in order to obtain a more 
														accurate orientation. Since the PID controller designed is used to determine how far away the 
														end-effector is from facing the light source, this value needs to be added or subtracted to the 
														current angle the servo motor is positioned at. Thus, depending on the sign of the error values, 
														the PID offset angle is either added or subtract from the current motor angle. Next, the actual 
														PID control is applied and used to calculate the angle offset the end-effector is for the motor of 
														interest (i.e. x or y) based on the error obtained. The third part is to obtain the actual angle 
														that the motor needs to be at to ensure the light tracker is at its optimal position. The fourth 
														part involves incorporating the limitations of the motor. As the motor can only rotate from 0 to 
														180 degrees, if the control output is to write a motor angle out of this range, the control output 
														is simply saturated. Finally, the angle calculated for the motors through this entire procedure is 
														written to the servo motor using the servo.Write() function.</p>

														<h4>Electronic Hardware Implementation</h4>
														<p>To physically realize this solar tracker project, the system must be implemented through 
															electronic hardware using sensor integration and signal conditioning. 
															The electrical schematic of this system can be seen below.</p>
															<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\electrical schematic.png" alt="" style="width:55%;"></a>
														<P></P>
														<p>From the above schematic, it can be seen that six LDRs in a voltage divider configuration 
															and 2 servo motor actuators were used. Similar to previous labs, the voltage divider is 
															required to perform the necessary signal conditioning to convert a change in resistance 
															from the LDRs to a voltage signal that can be measured by the Arduino. This is then measured 
															using the analogRead() Arduino function which returns a value ranging from 0-1023 due to its 
															10-bit ADC. The servo motors allow the robot to span 3D space and move to the appropriate 
															position as calculated by the PID controller.</p>

														<h4>Mechanical Implementation and CAD Justification</h4>

														<p>The purpose of the light solar tracker is to allow the user to obtain the most amount of light possible
															, by orientating the tracker to the most optimal position. To physically ensure the light tracker is 
															completing this task, the group decided that the solar tracker would have 2 degrees of freedom 
															(i.e. 2 motors) in order to span 3D space. The motors can be observed in the CAD below. <br /> 
															<br />
															The structural integrity of the solar tracker was a main concern for the group, so the group decided to 
															spend a significant time in designing a light tracker that could fully support itself under a reasonable 
															amount of stress and vibrations. A major concern was how well the structure would hold with two servo
															motors being implemented in it. Vibrations are a major reason structures fail or collapse, so the group 
															decided that the motor would need to be securely added to the light tracker. As can be observed in the
															figure below, the servo motors are a tight fit with the structure itself, limiting the movement
															of the motor, as it is running. One motor is placed vertically and the other horizontally, 
															allowing for two degrees of freedom. The bottom motor allows the light tracker to rotate in
															the horizontal (xy) plane and the motor above it allows the tracker to rotate in the vertical plane. <br />
															<br />
															Finally, the last part of the CAD is the end effector of the solar tracker, where the six light dependent 
															resistors are located. They are equally spaced out, to maximize its range and optimize the amount of light 
															that the tracker will obtain when running. In conclusion, the functionality of the light tracker is 
															directly proportional to how the tracker itself is designed, which is why the group selected it to 
															be of the highest priority.

																<h4>Results</h4>
																<p>Table below shows the sample data collect by the six LDR sensors for 15 samples. The coordinates 
																	represent the calculated position the light source is located with respect to the body attached 
																	coordinate frame on the end-effector.</p>
																	<a  class="image fit"></a><img src="Light-tracker images\Table Data.PNG" alt="" class="center" style="width:65%;"></a>
																	<p></p>
																	<p>The output of the sensor varies with respect to the intensity of the light. With the configuration of the
																		 voltage divider used to measure the LDR readings, when the intensity of light increases, the value 
																		 returned by the Arduino code analogRead() function is lower as seen in the table above. <br />
																		 <br />
																		 Since the LDRs are separated by opaque light barriers, any sensors that are on the other side of the barrier 
																		 are cast into a shadow and would generate higher analogRead() value. For example, the 
																		 data collected are a representation of a light source located on the LDR 4 and 5 side, which resulted 
																		 in a low output for those LDR sensors and a high output by LDR 1 and 2.
